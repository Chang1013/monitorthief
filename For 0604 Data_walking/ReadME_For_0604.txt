RT mean Receiver to Transmitter.
TR mean Transmitter to Receiver.

---------

If the filename is walk_RT_0604_amp_sqrt_v1, it means that we collect the csi data about walking from reveiver to transmitter and the value are amplitude in csv. 

0604 is the date June 4
---------

amp = amplitude
mag = magnitude

---------

v1 is collect the first time.
v2 is collect the second time.
etc.

About Picture name:
For example,
0517_walk_RT1_pca1 : first walk from the receiver to the transmitter and use PCA to extract the first principal component
0517_walk_RT2_pca2 : second walk from the receiver to the transmitter and use PCA to extract the second principal component
0517_walk_RT1-5_pca1_similar: Compare the PCA first principal components of RT1 to 5 and select similar waveforms to put together
